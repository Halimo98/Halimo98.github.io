    <h1> All about Halimo </h1>
    <section>
      <p> My name is Halimo, I was born in Kenya .
        I love food, especially seafood.
       
       I believe in speaking things into existence. I think words are very powerful and I'm glad 12 year old me was an optimist. I am proud of how far I have come and my journey.
         I think it's important to give yourself some credit even for the smallest growth.
