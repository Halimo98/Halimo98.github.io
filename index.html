    <h1> All about Halimo </h1>
    <section>
      <p> My name is Halimo, I was born in Kenya in a refugee camp. My family and I came to the U.S. when I was seven years old.
        I love food, especially seafood.I am student at UMASS Boston and I am a Psychology major.
        I enjoy working with young children and learning from them everyday.I think there is alot to learn from little kids.
       I beleive in speaking things into existence. When I was 12 I told my mom I would go to college and she did not have to worry about funding my education because I would apply for lots of scholarships when it was time.
        Years later I am in college and was able to fund my education through scholarships. I think words are very powerful and I'm glad 12 year old me was an optimist. I am proud of how far I have come and my journey.
         I think it's important to give yourself some credit even for the smallest growth.
