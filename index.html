    <h1 id="title"> All about Halimo </h1>
    <section>
      <p class="Halimo"> My name is Halimo, I was born in Kenya .
        I love food, especially seafood.
       
       I believe in speaking things into existence. I think words are very powerful.I remember telling my mom about the goals I would like to achieve at 18 when I was 12 and actually achieving them without realizing it. I am proud of how far I have come and my journey.
         I think it's important to give yourself some credit even for the smallest growth.
